# Appatella Research API

# Brief
The Appatella Research API in it's first instance will be able to export a copy the database for analysis. However, before that can happen, all instances of each course id must be replaced with a new uuid.
Once the database copy for exportation has been anonymised, it will be encrypted with a given secret. The user will then be able to download the encrypted and anonymised DB.
